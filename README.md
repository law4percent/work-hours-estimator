# Work Hours Estimator (Python)

This project provides two Python scripts to help calculate **working hours and dates** while excluding weekends (Saturday & Sunday).  
The system assumes **2 days = 15.0 hours**, or **7.5 hours per working day**.

Do you also want me to **merge both versions into a single CLI tool** (with options `--mode hours` or `--mode enddate`) so you can just run one file instead of two?
